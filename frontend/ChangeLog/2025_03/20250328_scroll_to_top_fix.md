# Scroll to Top Fix - DetailedPostView

## Original Request Summary
Fix the issue where when users scroll down the page and click on a post to view detailed post view, the page doesn't scroll back to the top.

## Quick Simple Overall Changes with Reason
Added scroll to top functionality when:
1. Opening a detailed post view
2. Returning to the feed view

The changes ensure better user experience by automatically positioning the viewport at the top of the content when navigation occurs, eliminating the need for manual scrolling.

## Key Features Implemented
- Smooth scrolling to top when opening post details
- Smooth scrolling to top when returning to feed view
- Better user experience for deep-scrolled content

## Key Code Sections Implemented Changes with Explanation

### Post Click Handler
```typescript
const handlePostClick = (post: Post) => {
    // Scroll to top when viewing a post detail
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
    setSelectedPost(post);
};
```
Added `window.scrollTo()` to ensure the window scrolls to the top with a smooth animation when a user clicks on a post to view its details.

### Back to Feed Handler
```typescript
const handleBackToFeed = () => {
    // Scroll to top when returning to feed
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
    setSelectedPost(null);
};
```
Added similar scroll-to-top functionality when returning to the feed view, providing a consistent experience in both directions of navigation.

## File Changes
- **frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx** - Updated to add scroll to top functionality when navigating between feed and detailed post views.

## Detailed Suggestions for Next Steps
1. **User Preferences**
   - Consider adding user settings to control scroll behavior (instant vs. smooth)
   - Allow users to disable auto-scrolling if they prefer

2. **Scroll Position Memory**
   - Implement scroll position memory for the feed view so users can return to their previous position when going back from a detailed post

3. **Scroll Indicators**
   - Add visual indicators when auto-scrolling occurs
   - Consider adding a "back to top" button for long content pages

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor performance impact of smooth scrolling on lower-end devices
   - Consider adding a conditional check to only use smooth scrolling on capable devices

## Technical Debt to Address
1. **Scroll Management**
   - Consider implementing a centralized scroll management utility for consistent scrolling behavior across the application
   - Document the scrolling patterns for other developers

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Monitor and optimize animation performance for smoother transitions
   - Consider adding throttling for scroll events to prevent performance issues

3. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure all scroll behaviors work well with screen readers
   - Add proper focus management when scrolling to different sections
