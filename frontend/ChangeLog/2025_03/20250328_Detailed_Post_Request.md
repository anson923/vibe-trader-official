# Post Section Redesign Summary

## Original Request
The user requested a redesign of the central post section on the main page with the following requirements:
- Clicking on a post should change the central section to show a detailed view
- Detailed view should include comments and nested replies
- Comments should have a transparent design
- Clear hierarchical structure for nested comments
- Parent comments should be collapsed by default
- Include control elements to expand comments
- Design should be responsive and align with website design

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Data Structure Updates
Updated the Comment interface to support nested replies:

```typescript
export interface Comment {
    id: string;
    author: User;
    content: string;
    createdAt: string;
    likes: number;
    replies?: Comment[]; // Added support for nested replies
}
```

### 2. New Component Creation
Created a new `DetailedPostView` component with key features:
- Collapsible comment threads
- Nested reply support
- Transparent comment design
- Keyboard accessibility
- Dark mode support

Key code sections:

```typescript
// Comment collapse/expand functionality
const CommentWithReplies = ({ comment }: { comment: Comment }) => {
    const [showReplies, setShowReplies] = useState(false);
    const hasReplies = comment.replies && comment.replies.length > 0;
    
    // ... rest of the implementation
};
```

### 3. HomePage Component Updates
Modified HomePage to handle post selection and detailed view:

```typescript
const HomePage = () => {
    const [selectedPost, setSelectedPost] = useState<Post | null>(null);

    const handlePostClick = (post: Post) => {
        setSelectedPost(post);
    };

    const handleBackToFeed = () => {
        setSelectedPost(null);
    };

    return (
        <MainLayout>
            {selectedPost ? (
                <DetailedPostView post={selectedPost} onBack={handleBackToFeed} />
            ) : (
                // ... feed view implementation
            )}
        </MainLayout>
    );
};
```

### 4. PostCard Component Enhancements
Updated PostCard to be more interactive and accessible:
- Added click handlers for post selection
- Improved keyboard navigation
- Enhanced hover effects

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Nested Comments**
   - Hierarchical comment structure
   - Collapsible comment threads
   - Visual indication of reply depth

2. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - ARIA labels
   - Focus management
   - Screen reader friendly structure

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Transparent comment backgrounds
   - Smooth transitions
   - Responsive design
   - Dark mode support

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Comment collapse/expand controls
   - Reply functionality
   - Like/Unlike interactions
   - Back to feed navigation

## Suggestions for Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement comment pagination
   - Add lazy loading for images
   - Consider virtualization for long comment threads

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Add comment editing functionality
   - Implement comment deletion
   - Add rich text support for comments
   - Include emoji reactions

3. **User Experience**
   - Add loading states
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add success/error notifications
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for new components
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add accessibility tests
   - Test cross-browser compatibility

5. **Backend Integration**
   - Connect with real API endpoints
   - Implement real-time updates
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement data caching

## Technical Debt to Address
1. State Management
   - Consider implementing Redux/Context for better state management
   - Add proper loading and error states

2. Code Organization
   - Split larger components into smaller, reusable pieces
   - Create shared UI components for common elements

3. Type Safety
   - Add stricter TypeScript types
   - Implement proper error handling types

4. Documentation
   - Add JSDoc comments
   - Create component documentation
   - Document props and interfaces
