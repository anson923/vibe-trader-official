# Home Button Navigation from Detail Post 

## Original Request Summary
When on the detail post page, clicking the Home button should navigate back to the feed page and exit the detail post section.

## Quick Simple Overall Changes with Reason
Modified the navigation system to make the Home button functional while in the detail post view, providing a consistent way for users to return to the feed from any part of the navigation.

## Key Features Implemented
- Updated LeftSidebar and MobileNav to handle Home button clicks while on the detail post page
- Created a centralized home navigation control from the MainLayout to HomePage

---

## Key Code Sections Implemented Changes with Explanation

### Navigation Components Updated
- Added `onHomeClick` prop to LeftSidebar and MobileNav components
- Implemented conditional logic to check if we're on the home page before triggering the custom handler
- Used `useLocation` from react-router-dom to detect the current page

### State Management
- Passed the `handleBackToFeed` function from HomePage to the navigation components via MainLayout
- Maintained the existing behavior of the back button in the DetailedPostView

### Component Chain
- HomePage passes `handleBackToFeed` to MainLayout via `onHomeClick`
- MainLayout passes it to both LeftSidebar and MobileNav
- When clicked, the Home button executes the function and clears the selected post

## File Changes
- frontend/src/components/layout/LeftSidebar.tsx - Added onHomeClick prop and handler to return to feed
- frontend/src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx - Added onHomeClick prop and handler to return to feed
- frontend/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx - Updated to pass the onHomeClick prop to navigation components
- frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx - Added onHomeClick prop to MainLayout to pass the handleBackToFeed function

## Detailed Suggestions for Next Steps
1. Consider adding a visual indicator in the navigation when viewing a detail post
2. Implement the same pattern for other navigation components if needed
3. Add animations for transitions between feed and detail views
4. Consider a breadcrumb navigation for better UX in nested views

## Technical Debt to Address
- Navigation logic is now spread across multiple components and could be centralized
- Consider using context API for global navigation state management
- Add proper testing for navigation flows
